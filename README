Line Fractal Generator

This is an HTML5 app which can recursively generate some pretty swell looking line fractals from a user-provided template. I'm using KineticJS for graphics and jQuery for interactivity (naturally). It should be relatively efficient, but that said, browsers can only handle so much data, so it'll freeze up at a certain point. I've set a reasonably optimistic upper bound for fractal complexity, but some users may experience hangups before reaching this point. We await browsers of the future with open arms.

Credit where credit is due: my buddy from back in the day Craig (http://www.craigm.info) once made something similar to this as a desktop program (using REALbasic, if I recall). I didn't use any of his code, but hey, ideas mean a lot.

I was surprised to find that this works in the latest IE, so that's cool. However, it probably won't work in most older browsers, as it relies on HTML5 canvas support for graphics. As always, I recommend the most recent version of Google Chrome for all things.
